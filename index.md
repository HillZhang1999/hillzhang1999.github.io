Hi, my name is Yu Zhang ([jy tʃɑŋ], 張宇/张宇 in traditional/simplified Chinese).
I am a first-year PhD student at [HLT@SUDA](http://hlt.suda.edu.cn), co-advised by [Prof. Guohong Fu](http://web.suda.edu.cn/ghfu/) and [Prof. Zhenghua Li](http://hlt.suda.edu.cn/~zhli) (expected to graduate in 2024). 
Before this, I received my M. Eng. degree from Soochow University in 2021.
My main research interest focuses on structured prediction and latent variable models.
